=head1 NAME

App::mqtt2job - Subscribe to an MQTT topic and trigger job execution

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  mqtt2job --mqtt_server mqtt.example.com --base_topic my/topic --job_dir /apps

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Subscribes to the my/topic/job mqtt topic and upon receiving a 
correctly formatted json message will fork and run the requested 
job in a wrapper script providing it is present and executable in 
the job_dir directory. 

This wrapper will generate two child mqtt messages under the base 
topic, at my/topic/status. Message one is sent when the job is 
initiated. The second is sent when the job has completed (or timed 
out). This second message will also include any output from the job 
amongst various other metadata (e.g. execution datetime, duration, 
timeout condition, etc.)
